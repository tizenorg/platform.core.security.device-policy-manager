  * @brief The Device Policy Management framework provides APIs to create
  * security-aware applications that are useful in enterprise settings.
  * <br>
  * @section CAPI_SECURITY_DPM_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
  * The primary purpose of the DPM(Device Policy Management) framework is
  * to support enterprise applications, which require integration with
  * policies enforced on the device to restrict their operations on
  * some circumstance, such as Exchange ActiveSync or corporate apps.<br>
  * The device policy API supports the policies listed in the below table, and
  * any application can subscribe those policies by registring policy changed callback to
  * the device policy manager.

  * manager as the device admin client by enrollment process. Other unregistered
  * application are only allowed to subscribe policy change notification published by
  * the device policy manager.

  * @brief The policy client provides functions required to access the device policy APIs.
  * @section CAPI_DPM_MANAGER_MODULE_HEADER Required Header
  *  \#include <dpm/device-policy-manager.h>
  * @section CAPI_DPM_MANAGER_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
  * The Policy Manager module provides Device Policy Manager handle which keeps track of
  * state between the device admin client and the device policy manager.
  * The device admin clients must create the handle by using dpm_manager_create()
  * before attempting to use almost any of the device policy APIs, and the handle should be
  * freed by using dpm_manager_destroy() when interaction with the device policy manager
  * is no longer required.
